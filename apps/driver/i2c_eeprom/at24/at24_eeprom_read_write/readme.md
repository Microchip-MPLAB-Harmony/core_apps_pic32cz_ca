# I2C EEPROM AT24 driver - EEPROM Read Write

This example application shows how to use the AT24 driver to perform read and write operations on AT24 series of EEPROM.

## Description

- This example uses the AT24 driver to communicate with I2C based AT24MAC402 series EEPROMs to perform write and read operations.

### Setting up [PIC32CZ-CA90 Curiosity Ultra board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - One [EEPROM 3 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click) board
- Connect [EEPROM 3 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click) board on the mikroBUS header
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. LED is turned ON when the data read from EEPROM matches with the written data

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
